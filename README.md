## Introduction

SeMu is a little open source project that is targeted to emulate the orignal Nintendo Switch (before the revision). The target of the project as a hole is to learn to emulate the switch in a C++ enviroment and leaviing enough room to expand on the application. 

## Installation

Once you have Node.js installed:

```shell
# Get the project:
git https://github.com/thijsrijkers/semu.git
```

## Hardware

These are the leaked hardware specs of the switch:

```

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Change</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>memory_limit</td>
<td>In your PHP.ini file of your XAMPP you need to change the memory_limit to 1024M because the data can be to great to handle for XAMPP</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

```
